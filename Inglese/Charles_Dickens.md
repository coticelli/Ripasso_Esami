## üèõÔ∏è The Victorian Age: A Time of Contradiction

The reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901) was an era of:
*   **Progress:** The **Industrial Revolution** led to enormous economic growth, technological innovation, and the expansion of the British Empire.
*   **Poverty:** This progress came at a high cost. It created a new urban working class that lived in terrible conditions:
    *   **Overcrowded slums** with poor sanitation.
    *   **Exploitation of workers**, including **child labour** in factories and mines.
    *   **Extreme poverty** and social injustice.

This contrast between wealth and poverty is the central theme of Dickens' novels. He became the voice of the poor and the oppressed.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Dickens' Aims and Style

Dickens' goal was to **denounce the social evils** of his time and to **awaken the conscience** of his readers, particularly the middle class. He wanted to inspire moral and social reform.

### His style is characterized by:
*   **Engaging plots:** His novels are full of suspense, mystery, and incredible coincidences. They were often published in monthly installments, so he needed to keep his readers hooked.
*   **Unforgettable characters:** He created iconic characters that are often **caricatures**, representing specific human virtues or vices (e.g., the cruel Scrooge, the innocent Oliver Twist). They are rarely complex psychological portraits but are incredibly effective.
*   **Pathos and sentimentality:** Dickens masterfully used emotional scenes to make his readers sympathize with the suffering of his characters.
*   **Detailed descriptions:** He provided vivid and realistic descriptions of London's slums, factories, and institutions, making the city a character in itself.

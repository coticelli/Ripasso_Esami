This module explores the fundamental technologies that power the World Wide Web, from the structure of a web page to the protocols that make online communication possible and secure.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components of a Website

*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The **skeleton** of a web page. It defines the structure and the content (headings, paragraphs, images, links).
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** The **style** of a web page. It controls the presentation, formatting, and layout (colors, fonts, spacing).
*   **JavaScript:** The **brain** of a web page. It makes the site interactive and dynamic (animations, pop-ups, forms validation).
*   **Web App (Application):** An interactive application that runs in a web browser. Unlike a simple website, it allows users to perform tasks (e.g., Gmail, Google Docs).

## üåê Communication Protocols: The Rules of the Road

*   **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** The standard protocol used to transfer data over the web. When you type a web address, your browser sends an HTTP request to a server.
*   **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):** The **secure version** of HTTP. It **encrypts** the data exchanged between your browser and the server, making it unreadable to third parties. It is essential for online banking, e-commerce, and any site that handles sensitive information. You can recognize it by the padlock icon üîí in the address bar.
*   **DNS (Domain Name System):** The "phonebook of the internet." It translates human-readable domain names (like `www.google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `172.217.16.142`). Without DNS, we would have to remember long strings of numbers to visit websites.

## üìà Visibility and Security

*   **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** The process of optimizing a website to **rank higher** in search engine results (like Google). Good SEO involves using relevant keywords, creating quality content, having a fast and mobile-friendly site, and getting links from other reputable sites.
*   **Online Security Threats:**
    *   **Phishing:** Deceptive emails or websites that try to trick you into revealing personal information (passwords, credit card numbers).
    *   **Malware (Malicious Software):** Software designed to harm your computer, such as **viruses** (which replicate) and **ransomware** (which blocks access to your files until you pay a ransom).
    *   **Data Breach:** An incident where sensitive or confidential information is stolen from a company's database.

**Golden Rule:** Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible.

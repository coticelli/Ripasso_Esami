## âœ¨ The Aesthetic Movement: "Art for Art's Sake"

Aestheticism was a late 19th-century art movement based on a core principle:
> **"Art for Art's Sake" (L'arte per il gusto dell'arte)**

**Key Ideas:**
*   **Art has no moral purpose:** The only goal of art is to be beautiful. It should not teach or moralize.
*   **Rejection of Victorian values:** The Aesthetes rejected the strict moralism and pragmatism of the Victorian Age.
*   **Life as a work of art:** The ideal figure is the **dandy**, a man who turns his own life into a masterpiece of elegance and sophistication, despising the vulgarity of the common world.
*   **The Cult of Beauty:** The pursuit of beauty is the ultimate goal in both art and life.

Oscar Wilde embodied the dandy. His life was a performance, a deliberate rebellion against social conventions.

## ðŸ“– Major Works and Themes

### *The Picture of Dorian Gray* (1890)
This novel is the manifesto of Aestheticism.
*   **Plot:** Dorian Gray, a handsome young man, wishes that his portrait would age instead of him. His wish comes true. While he pursues a life of pleasure and sin, his face remains young and beautiful, but the portrait becomes a monstrous reflection of his corrupted soul.
*   **Themes:**
    *   **The price of eternal beauty:** The novel explores the dangerous consequences of separating beauty from morality.
    *   **The double:** The contrast between Dorian's perfect appearance and his evil inner self.
    *   **Faustian pact:** Dorian sells his soul not for knowledge, but for beauty and youth.

### *The Importance of Being Earnest* (1895)
This is Wilde's most famous play, a brilliant comedy of manners.
*   **Plot:** Two young men, Jack and Algernon, create a fictional person named "Ernest" to escape their social obligations. This leads to a series of hilarious misunderstandings and paradoxes.
*   **Themes:**
    *   **Critique of the Victorian aristocracy:** The play satirizes the superficiality, hypocrisy, and foolishness of the upper class.
    *   **The trivial and the serious:** Wilde famously stated, "In matters of great importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing." The play masterfully plays with this idea.
    *   **Verbal wit and epigrams:** The dialogue is full of clever, paradoxical, and unforgettable lines (aphorisms).

Wilde's life ended tragically after he was imprisoned for "gross indecency" (homosexuality), but his work remains a powerful testament to the liberating force of art and individuality.

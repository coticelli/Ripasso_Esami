## ðŸ“š Reading Comprehension: Key Strategies

The reading section tests your ability to understand different types of texts (articles, emails, stories, advertisements).

### What to focus on:
*   **Skimming (Lettura veloce):** Quickly read the text to get the **general idea** (gist). What is the main topic? What is the author's purpose?
*   **Scanning (Ricerca mirata):** Look for **specific information** (names, dates, numbers, keywords) to answer detailed questions. You don't need to read every word.
*   **Understanding Vocabulary from Context:** If you don't know a word, try to guess its meaning from the surrounding sentences.
*   **Identifying the Main Idea vs. Details:** Learn to distinguish between the central message of a paragraph and the supporting details or examples.
*   **Inference (Inferenza):** Some questions ask you to "read between the lines." You have to understand what the author *implies*.

### Common Task Types:
*   Multiple choice questions
*   True/False/Not Given
*   Matching (e.g., matching headings to paragraphs)
*   Sentence completion

## ðŸŽ§ Listening Comprehension: Key Strategies

The listening section tests your ability to understand spoken English in various contexts (announcements, conversations, short talks).

### How to improve:
*   **Active Listening:** Don't just hear the words, try to understand the meaning, the context, and the speaker's tone.
*   **Predicting Content:** Before listening, read the questions carefully. This helps you predict what the topic will be and what information you need to listen for.
*   **Focus on Keywords:** You can't remember everything. Focus on the key words and phrases that will help you answer the questions.
*   **Don't Panic if You Miss Something:** If you don't understand a word or a sentence, stay calm and keep listening. You might be able to get the answer from the rest of the conversation.
*   **Listen for Signposting Language:** Speakers often use phrases to structure their talk (e.g., *"First...", "Next...", "To sum up..."*). These are important clues.

### Common Task Types:
*   Multiple choice questions
*   Filling in gaps in a text
*   Matching speakers to opinions
